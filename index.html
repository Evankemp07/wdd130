        Hi everyone, my name is Evan! I was born in Maryland, but moved to Pennsylvania when I was 3. I grew up with 3 sisters and 2 brothers. My favorite color is green. I have absolutely way too many hobbies. I love everything from computers to hiking. Some of my favorite hobbies are graphic design, hiking, gardening, 3d printing, baking, laser engraving/cutting, Christmas lights (not the ones you get at the store), photography, and coding.

        During the holiday season, I decorate my house in over 5,000 RGB lights that are synchronized to holiday tunes and hand out candy canes and free ice-cream vouchers.
